# 3D-CNN-AND-RNN-from-scratch
Visualization of CNN with different activation function, filters and pooling layer. Created Dataset from mnist dataset then Loads a 3D point cloud from an HDF5 file. Converts it into a 3D voxel grid Transforms the voxel grid into a PyTorch tensor. Applies 3D convolution to extract features from the voxel data. Processes the data through an activation function ( Outputs a new voxel feature tensor for further processing) you will be able to see how CNN works and at last cnn connected to ann through gap output 
Comparison of different  RNN (base ,GRU AND LSTM ) using MSE loss function over a manually created datset
